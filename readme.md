# ClassExercises

## Built with Node.js, Express, Bootstrap, Jquery, javascript EJ6, and various APIs.

### What is it for?

+ To Display What I learned in the New York Code + Academy BootCamp

+ It is a **fun** way seperate so I can focus on one **particular skill** per page

#### button war does effects when you press buttons

+ this first button replaces the entire background picture with an atomic blast. Then the backgroundColor color with a function that changes the rgba values so that it becomes white.

+ the second button cripples the first button by fading it out. In other words it cuts the opacity value in half.

+ The third button is a landmine. It blows up after you hover over it.

#### Hangman was an exercise that the class did so that we could detect and display the value of button presses.

+ I used this exercise an opportunity to make a game of hangman. I made arrays in a JS file of categories and answers. Every time the page is loaded it will generate a random category with a word that is a part of that category. The letters are created consecutively as blank boxes, sprawled across the page in a flex display style. The word should be 100% the screen size. So if the client hits a correct key the corresponding boxes are filled. If the client hits the wrong key then a new part of the hung victim fills the hangman picture.

#### Seinfeld elevator lobby was an exercise that we were assigned to teach us how to use the setTimeout function

+ I really enjoyed this assignment. It was simply a console output at first. We had just learn to do objects with javascript. I decided to make it into an entire story line. After I graduated I made it into a page. I added the elevator doors. Then the rug and the walls. Finally I put an API connection to Giphy. 

### Graduated on June 28th
